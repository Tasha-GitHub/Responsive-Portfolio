			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p> Hi, I’m Tasha. I am a currently a student at the Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin. I have many hobbies which include but are not limited to the following: Skating, Hiking, Fishing and Swimming. I also foster kittens every now and then. I am very excited to learn more about the Web Development world. Please feel free to check out my profile with my current work.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			When it comes to coding, I'd have to say my favorite language thus far is JavaScript. I really like manipulating components of a webpage and figuring out new and interesting tricks. I also really enjoying using JQuery.
			</p>

			Before I started web development, I studied Bioengineering, at Binghamton University. Shortly after that I got a position as a Clinical Engineering Manager and floated around the US sitting at hospitals that didn’t have any managers. I found this was not the best fit for me so I settled in Austin and became a Data Analyst for a Digital Advertising Company. I found that in this field, all too often I would work with AdWords Scripts. This got me interested in JavaScript and thus started this new path.
